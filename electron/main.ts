/**
 * Electron main-process skeleton.
 *
 * ADR 0001 (Accepted) adopts Electron as DASH's installable shell. This is the
 * first structural slice of it: a window, the security posture, and the audited
 * command boundary. Nothing else.
 *
 * **What this deliberately does not do**, per the ADR's "Not decided here":
 * no secret storage, no `safeStorage`, no OAuth, no credential UI, no local
 * bridge or ingest server, no packaging. `SecureStore` (`lib/secure-store.ts`)
 * is a seam with no implementation, and nothing in this file touches it.
 *
 * The file is intentionally thin. Everything with a rule in it — the renderer
 * posture, the URL allowlist, the command review — lives in pure modules under
 * `lib/shell/` that are unit-tested without launching Electron. What remains
 * here is wiring, which is the part that cannot be tested without a real
 * Electron process and therefore should be as small as possible.
